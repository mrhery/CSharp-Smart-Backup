# Backup Mode
# 1. mode=realtime
#		Realtime mode will send the file right after changes has been made.
#		Example: mode=realtime
#
# 2. mode=cycle:time
#		Cycle mode will send the file when the time reach the setted timer
#		Time setting is in minute
#		Example: mode=cycle:30 *this will run every 30 minute
#
# 3. mode=daily:time
#		Cycle mode will send the file everyday at the setted time
#		Time setting is in 24 hour format.
#		Example: mode=cycle:23:30 *this will run on 11 30 PM every day.

# Default mode is realtime

mode=realtime

# File Path
# You can set multiple path to backup multiple path.
#

path=C:\xampp\htdocs
path=C:\Users\User\Documents

# Server Setting
# You can also set multiple server for multiple duplication.
# The best way for multiple duplication server copy is setting from the server itself (if you run your own backup server).
# Run multiple duplication from the client setting will employs higher client server usage (bandwidth, cpu, ram etc.) and might slowed client server when the duplication is in process.
#
# Username and password can be generated from the server. Its better to created each client server with on username and password.
# To enable default encryption, can put encrpytion=true after port number. By default, the encryption is not enable.
# Default encryption is AES and please be noted that encrypted file will be stored in base64 which is will increase the file size to 30%~40%.
# Encryption & encoding to base64 process will uses client server's cpu usage higher than usual.

server=username:password@host:port
server=username:password@host:port:encryption=true
server=username:password@host:port:encryption=false

# Encryption Key
# I you are enabling AES Encryption, then you need to define you password with aes_key=your_password

aes_key=you_password_here
